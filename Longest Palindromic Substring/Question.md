## Longest Palindromic Substring

---

Given a string, find the largest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one wirth the maximum length,return the one with smaller start index.

for example the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb".
The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana"

### Input Format
The first and the only line of input contains an input string.

### Constraints
The input string contains only lowercase characters and length of input string is in the range : [1,1000]

### Output Format
The first and the only line of output must print the longest palindromic substring.


#### Sample Input 1:
